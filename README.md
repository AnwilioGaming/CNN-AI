# CNN-AI

This project is a CNN \[Convolution Neural Network\]

CNNs are a convolution based machine learning that are fundumentally used in interpreting and collecting image data. They work by getting a convolution filter across a series of files in a massive data storage pool for testing, in which the series of convolution filters create a output, in which the extreme values from the noise mesh are then pooled into more significant and compressed values, and after repitiion create a more workable array of values for then a ANN to work and deduse on.
